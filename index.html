        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Ryan Shin and I am an undergraduate college student studying towards a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Economic Administrative Studies. <br><br>

       I believe that meaningful work begins with a sense of purpose, but also change is constant while Teamwork is also fundamental with my approach. Whether taking on new challenges and adjusting or learning different things, I am flexible and resilient. I am a great collaborator and am always respectful towards othersâ€™ views. Listening, supporting, and valuing each member's outputs and fostering to be productive and positive in the work environment. When there is a goal, work helps me stay motivated and focused with small tasks or large projects. <br><br>
